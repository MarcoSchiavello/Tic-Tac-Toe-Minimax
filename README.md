C implementation of a famous Tic-tac-toe algorithm called MInimax inspired by game theory to always win or at least draw.
The game implementation was done through console interaction i.e. printing on the console and asking the input from the keyboard.

A web implementation of the game was made at this repo: https://github.com/MarcoSchiavello/Tic-tac-toe-webApp
